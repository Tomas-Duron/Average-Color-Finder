# Average-Color-Finder
A python project that will find the average color of an image.

The test image (Shurelya's Battlesong, it's what I had lying around.):

![Alt text](test.png?raw=true "Test Image, Shurelya's Battlesong")

The average color from the image:

![Alt text](avgcol.PNG?raw=true "Average color from test image")
